# Golang facts

 > Modern, concise, simple, compiled language created at google by Robert, Pike, Thompson (2007 and first release in 2009).
 
 > Cross-platform, well documented and open source.
 
 > `package main` (standalone, exceutable and entrypoint for main function)
 
 > `func main` (function called main). func main () { all function code goes in here}
 
 > import {module} or `import ("fmt" "runtime")` 
 
 > fmt is a shared Go-module. runtime is shared module too. `runtime.GOOS` shows what operating system is running. 
 
 > `bin, src, pkg` folders required to run and compile go programs. file has a `.go` ext.
 
 > cd to code-folder and `go run file.go`
 
 > it's a case sensitive language. fmt.Println (capital used when working with exported names)
 
 > // line comments and /* for block comments */
 
 ### Variables and constants
 
 ### Looping
 
 > Go has only got one `for` loop and it's flexible
 
 ### Arrays and slices
 
 > slices built on top of arrays
 
 > slices reference to arrays.
 
 > arrays (ordered list) are rarely used as they are immutable. 
 
 ### Structs
 
 > making custom types
 
 ### maps
 
 > equivalent of dictionaries
 
 > stored in key- value format
 
 > they are printed/returned in unordered format
 
 ### Go-concurrency 
 
 > doing many things at one
 
 > go routines
 
 > channels
